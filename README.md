This is a great place to do things like:
- List features you need to complete
- Claim features to work on
  - ex. "Allow user to search properties by price **@YourName**"
- ~~Strikethrough~~ completed items to feel good

Alternatively, you can go the traditional route & use the README to document your team's Git/naming conventions.

Side note: plz manage your code changes with branches, especially if you're coding different features simultaneously.  The updated guide is here: [Getting Started with Git](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JCmHccq2WOZCHx98B95oSjZNzr3cS3Vil2ePiM81OBk/edit?usp=sharing)
