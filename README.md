# BevoBnB

Note: This project was designed for MIS 333K (web-application development). I took this course in Fall 2021.

## Goal: 
The purpose of this project was to develop a travel lodging website with functionality for guests, hosts and administrators. This project spanned the course of 2 months, and included functionality such as: detailed search and filter, role-based access management, profile and account creation, reservation/booking creation/deletion, password encryption, reviewing functionality for properties, listing and managing properties capability, admin reporting and user/reservation management, to name a few! This was a group project and I developed this app with my teammate. 

## Stack: 
**Front-end:** **C#** using **ASP.NET Core** framework using a MVC setup.  
**Back-end:** **C#** **MVC** with **Microsoft Azure SQL Database**.  
**Hosting:** Deployed on **Micrososft Azure** with **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** fully integrated into the app for login and security purposes. 

If you are curious, here is a full spec sheet of what the project requirements were, from start to finish!
